## Project Overview

**Empire of Vampire** is a mobile strategy game with vampire themes where I work as a Technical Designer, focusing on backend configuration systems, Unity actor management, and quest mechanics implementation.

## My Role & Responsibilities

### Technical Design
- **Backend Configuration**: Created and maintained JSON configuration files for backend systems
- **Data Management**: Structured game data in spreadsheet tables for efficient backend integration
- **System Integration**: Ensured seamless communication between frontend Unity client and backend services

### Unity Development
- **Actor Systems**: Configured and managed game actors, including behavior scripts and properties
- **Quest Implementation**: Designed and implemented quest systems with branching narratives and objectives
- **Scripting**: Developed and maintained Unity scripts for game mechanics and UI interactions

### Configuration Management
- **JSON Workflows**: Established efficient workflows for updating game configurations
- **Data Validation**: Implemented systems to validate configuration data before deployment
- **Version Control**: Managed configuration changes across different game versions

## Project Achievements

- **Live Service Support**: Maintained stable configuration systems for ongoing live service
- **Quest Variety**: Implemented diverse quest types with complex objective tracking
- **Data Reliability**: Achieved zero critical configuration errors in production
- **Team Collaboration**: Streamlined technical workflows between design and development teams

## Technical Challenges

### Backend Integration
- Designed robust JSON schemas for complex game data structures
- Implemented fallback systems for configuration loading failures
- Created tools for batch configuration updates

### Unity Actor Management
- Developed scalable actor systems supporting hundreds of concurrent entities
- Implemented efficient state management for complex actor behaviors
- Created debugging tools for actor system troubleshooting

### Quest System Architecture
- Built flexible quest framework supporting multiple objective types
- Implemented save/load systems for quest progress persistence
- Created validation systems for quest logic consistency

## Key Features Delivered

- **Dynamic Configuration System**: Real-time backend configuration updates
- **Complex Actor Behaviors**: AI-driven vampire characters with unique abilities
- **Branching Quest Narratives**: Multiple story paths with meaningful player choices
- **Data-Driven Gameplay**: Flexible systems allowing rapid content iteration

## Technologies & Tools

- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS
- **Data Formats**: JSON, CSV, Google Sheets integration
- **Version Control**: Git with configuration management workflows
- **Backend Integration**: RESTful APIs and real-time data synchronization
- **Testing Tools**: Custom Unity editor tools for configuration validation

## Impact & Learning

This project enhanced my skills in:
- **Backend Integration**: Deep understanding of client-server architecture
- **Data Management**: Efficient workflows for large-scale configuration management  
- **Unity Optimization**: Performance considerations for mobile platforms
- **Live Service Operations**: Real-time content updates and configuration management

Working on Empire of Vampire demonstrates my ability to handle complex technical systems while maintaining high reliability standards in a live service environment.
