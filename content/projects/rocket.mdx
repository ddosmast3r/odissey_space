  <div className="text-base leading-relaxed">
    Rocket represents my first serious attempt at game development using Unity. This platformer project taught me fundamental programming concepts, 
    Unity's prefab system, basic level design principles, and the complete game development pipeline from concept to playable prototype. 
    The game features classic platformer mechanics with a focus on learning and experimentation. Content and media coming soon!
