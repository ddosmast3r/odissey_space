## Project Overview

**Stint: Rift Apart** marks my entry into commercial game development as a Level Designer and Technical Designer. During this **intensive 6-month development period** (March - September 2022), I rapidly learned industry-standard tools and workflows while contributing to a complete commercial release that served as my foundation in professional game development.

## My Role & Responsibilities

### Level Design
- **Created 40+ Game Locations**: Designed diverse environments using Tiled map editor
- **Map Architecture**: Developed level layouts with strategic gameplay flow and player progression
- **Spatial Design**: Crafted environments that balanced exploration, combat, and narrative pacing
- **Iteration & Polish**: Refined level designs based on playtesting feedback and team input

### Technical Design
- **Unity Integration**: Successfully imported and implemented all Tiled maps into Unity engine
- **Prefab Management**: Systematic placement and organization of game objects throughout levels
- **Enemy AI Logic**: Designed and implemented enemy behavior patterns and spawning systems
- **Technical Problem-Solving**: Resolved integration challenges between Tiled and Unity workflows

### Tool Proficiency
- **Tiled Map Editor**: Mastered tile-based level design workflow and asset organization
- **Unity Engine**: Learned scene management, prefab systems, and component-based architecture
- **Version Control**: Collaborated using Git for asset and code management
- **Documentation**: Maintained design documents and technical specifications

## Technical Achievements

### Workflow Development
- **Tiled-to-Unity Pipeline**: Established efficient workflow for map import and processing
- **Asset Organization**: Created systematic approach to prefab management and scene hierarchy
- **Quality Assurance**: Implemented testing procedures for level functionality and performance

### System Design
- **Enemy Placement Strategy**: Developed placement logic for balanced difficulty progression
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Used level design to support game narrative and atmosphere
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensured levels met performance requirements across target platforms

## Key Learning Outcomes

This first commercial project provided invaluable experience in:

- **Professional Game Development**: Understanding of commercial development cycles and standards
- **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration**: Working effectively with programmers, artists, and designers
- **Industry Tools**: Hands-on experience with professional game development software
- **Problem-Solving**: Overcoming technical and design challenges in real production environment
- **Quality Standards**: Meeting commercial release requirements and player expectations
